                <p>You may provide information to be published or displayed (”Posted”) on public areas of websites you access through the App and areas within the App (collectively, ”User Contributions”).

                <p><strong>Automatic Information Collection and Tracking</strong></p>

                <p>When you download, access and use the App, it may use technology to automatically collect:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Usage Details. When you access and use the App, we may automatically collect certain details of your access to and use of the App, including traffic data, location data, logs and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on or through the App.</li>
                    <li>Device Information. We may collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the device’s unique device identifier, IP address, operating system, browser type, mobile network information and the device’s telephone number.</li>
                    <li>Stored Information and Files. The App also may access metadata and other information associated with other files stored on your device. This may include, for example, photographs, audio and video clips, personal contacts and address book information.</li>
                    <li>Location Information. This App collects real-time information about the location of your device to deliver you the services in the App.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you do not want us to collect this information do not download the App or delete it from your device.</p>

                <p>Note, however, that disabling the collection of location information through your device will cause its location-based features to be disabled and may cause some functions or services to not work. We also may use these technologies to collect information about your activities over time and across third-party websites, apps or other online services (behavioral tracking).</p>

                <p>Information Collection and Tracking Technologies The technologies we use for automatic information collection may include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cookies (or mobile cookies). A cookie is a small file placed on your smartphone. It may be possible to refuse to accept mobile cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your smartphone. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our App.</li>
                    <li>Web Beacons. Pages of the App and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit the Company, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other related app statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain app content and verifying system and server integrity).</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Third-party Information Collection</strong></p>

                <p>When you use the App or its content, certain third parties may use automatic information collection technologies to collect information about you or your device. These third parties may include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Advertisers, ad networks and ad servers.</li>
                    <li>Analytics companies.</li>
                    <li>Your mobile device manufacturer.</li>
                    <li>Your mobile service provider.</li>
                    <li>Social networks.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These third parties may use tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use this app. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites, apps and other online services websites. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.</p>

                <p>We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.</p>

                <p><strong>Location data</strong></p>

                <p>We confirm that we:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>will not resell a user’s location data to third parties without consent;</li>
                    <li>will use location data to enable location-based features within our services; and</li>
                    <li>may use the location data to improve our own services.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If we store or keep your location data, we will anonymize such data after collection to remove sonally identifiable information or device information.</p>

                <p><strong>IP addresses</strong></p>

                <p>We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.

                <p><strong>Where we store your personal data</strong></p>

                <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").

Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.</p>

                <p>By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

                <p>Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted via the App; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1).

                    <li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation (such as a warrant, subpeona, or other obligation), or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use at www.flixtremeapp.com or terms and conditions of supply and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Us, our customers, or others.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.
