                <p><strong>Terms applicable to the Ridesharing Feature</strong></p>

                <p>Flixtreme offers a technology solution to connect users to each other to share rides to locations described in the App. Flixtreme does not have any contractor, employment, or other relationship with any driver other than as a user of the App. Flixtreme does not provide or suggest compensation of a driver of any kind. Further, Flixtreeme does not monitor or control the driver and does not perform vehicle safety checks, driver records investigation, or driver background checks.</p>

                <p>We are not responsible for personal belongings left in the car by a passenger. It is the responsibility of the passenger to ensure they remove all personal belongings from the car after a ride.</p>

                <p>NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE PROVIDED AS TO DRIVER OR PASSENGER SAFETY.</p>

                <p>Nothing contained herein or on the App shall be deemed a warranty or guarantee, either express or implied, for the safety of a ride, the reliability of a driver, a ride or the driver's vehicle, or for anything else, and Flixtreme expressly disclaims all warranties as to its drivers and passengers. A user should take all reasonable steps in determining whether to accept a ride from driver or give a ride to a passenger. Mountain roads have variable conditions and can be extremely dangerous and the driver and passenger are responsible for safe travel.</p>

                <p>Flixtreme is not responsible for any damages (including personal injury, death, property damage, lost time or wages, and the like) resulting from or related to a ride facilitated by the App, or for resolving any disputes between you and another user.

WE RESERVE THE RIGHT, BUT HAVE NO OBLIGATION, TO MONITOR AND FACILITATE THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND OTHER USERS. FLIXTREME SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS, OR FOR ITS OR ANY USER'S ACTION OR INACTION</p>

                <p><strong>DRIVER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</strong></p>

                <p>By using the App and offering to drive another user, a driver represents, warrants and agrees that:</p>
